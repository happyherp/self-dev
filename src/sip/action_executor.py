"""Action executor for SIP.

This module will contain the action execution functionality for SIP (Self-Improving Program).
The action executor is responsible for translating high-level plans into concrete actions
and executing them in a controlled and monitored environment.

Currently this is a placeholder module that will be expanded in future development phases
to include action planning, execution monitoring, rollback capabilities, and integration
with the broader SIP workflow.

# Implementation will be added in next phase
