# feat: add persistent temporary directory to CodeEditor

## Summary

This PR adds persistent temporary directory management to the CodeEditor class to improve performance by reducing filesystem I/O operations during testing.

## Changes

- **State Management**: Added instance variables to track persistent temporary directory state
- **Lifecycle Management**: Implemented methods for initializing, synchronizing, and cleaning up the temporary directory
- **Performance Optimization**: Only writes files that have actually changed content
- **Backward Compatibility**: Public API remains unchanged
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup when CodeEditor instance is destroyed

## Benefits

- Reduces filesystem I/O by reusing the same temporary directory across multiple test runs
- Only writes changed files instead of copying entire repository structure each time
- Maintains working directory state across multiple operations
- Improves overall performance during code generation and testing cycles

## Testing

- All existing tests pass (64/64)
- CI pipeline passes completely
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Technical Details

The implementation adds several new private methods:
- `_initialize_temp_dir()`: Sets up the persistent temporary directory
- `_ensure_temp_dir_ready()`: Ensures directory exists and is synchronized
- `_sync_repo_changes()`: Synchronizes repository changes efficiently
- `_update_temp_dir()`: Applies changesets to the persistent directory
- `_cleanup_temp_dir()`: Handles cleanup and resource management

The `_test_changes_in_temp_repo()` method has been updated to use the persistent directory instead of creating new temporary directories for each test run.
