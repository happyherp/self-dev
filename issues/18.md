### Objective
Implement a "Hot Swap" mechanism for live CLI sessions to allow seamless program modifications during execution. Ensure robust error handling, recovery mechanisms, rapid performance, and restoration of session state for a smooth user experience.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **Hot Swap Command**
   - Users can execute a "Hot Swap" command during a CLI session to modify the program while editing.
   - The command replaces the currently running program with the updated version without requiring a restart.

2. **Error Handling**
   - The program must not crash completely if the "Hot Swap" command introduces an error.
   - Implement checks to ensure the applied changes are reasonable and do not destabilize the program.

3. **Recovery Mechanism**
   - Include a fallback mechanism that works reliably to restore the program to its previous stable state.
   - Recovery should occur automatically or be easily triggered by the user.

4. **Session State Restoration**
   - After applying the Hot Swap, the CLI session should restore to the exact state it was in prior to the swap.
   - For example, if the user was in the middle of editing a program, they should return to that same editing point seamlessly.

5. **Performance**
   - The Hot Swap process should complete within 10 seconds to minimize disruption and maintain session continuity.
